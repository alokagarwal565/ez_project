Document Title: Software Development Coding Standards
Effective Date: June 25, 2025
Version: 1.0

1. Introduction
These coding standards are designed to ensure consistency, readability, maintainability, and quality across all software developed at InnovateCorp. Adhering to these guidelines facilitates collaboration, reduces errors, and improves the long-term viability of our codebase.

2. General Principles

Clarity & Readability: Code should be easy to understand by others and by your future self.

Consistency: Follow established patterns and conventions within the codebase.

Maintainability: Write code that is easy to modify, debug, and extend.

Performance & Efficiency: Optimize for performance where critical, without sacrificing readability.

Security: Implement secure coding practices to prevent vulnerabilities.

3. Naming Conventions

Variables & Functions: Use camelCase (e.g., userName, calculateTotal). Descriptive names are preferred.

Classes & Types: Use PascalCase (e.g., UserProfile, PaymentGateway).

Constants: Use UPPER_SNAKE_CASE (e.g., MAX_RETRIES, DEFAULT_TIMEOUT).

Files: Use kebab-case or snake_case as per language/framework conventions (e.g., user-service.js, database_utils.py).

4. Code Formatting

Indentation: Use [e.g., 4 spaces or tabs - be specific to language].

Line Length: Limit lines to [e.g., 120 characters] for readability.

Braces: Consistent placement (e.g., K&R style or Allman style).

Whitespace: Use judiciously to improve readability (e.g., spaces around operators, after commas).

5. Comments & Documentation

Purpose: Use comments to explain why certain decisions were made, not just what the code does (which should be clear from the code itself).

Function/Method Headers: Document purpose, parameters, return values, and any side effects.

Complex Logic: Comment on intricate algorithms or business logic.

TODO/FIXME: Use TODO for future work, FIXME for known issues that need immediate attention.

6. Error Handling

Graceful Degradation: Implement robust error handling mechanisms.

Logging: Log errors with sufficient detail (e.g., timestamp, error type, stack trace).

User Feedback: Provide clear and informative error messages to end-users.

7. Modularity & Reusability

Single Responsibility Principle (SRP): Each module, class, or function should have one clear responsibility.

DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself): Avoid duplicating code. Refactor common logic into reusable components.

Encapsulation: Limit access to internal data and methods of an object.

8. Version Control (Git) Best Practices

Branching Strategy: Use a clear branching model (e.g., Git Flow, GitHub Flow).

Commit Messages: Write clear, concise, and descriptive commit messages using the [e.g., Conventional Commits] standard.

Small Commits: Aim for atomic commits that address a single logical change.

9. Code Review Process

Mandatory: All code changes must undergo a peer code review before merging into the main branch.

Constructive Feedback: Provide helpful and actionable feedback.

Responsibility: Developers are responsible for addressing review comments.

10. Tools & Linters
Utilize static analysis tools and linters (e.g., ESLint, Prettier, SonarQube) to automate adherence to these standards. Configuration files for these tools are located in the project repositories.

11. Continuous Improvement
These standards are living documents and will evolve. Suggestions for improvements are welcome and can be submitted to the Tech Lead.
